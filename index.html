					<h2>The cat thought he was a dog and the cat thought he was a dog</h2>
					<p>One was a poor farmer named Jan Skiba. He lived with his wife and three daughters in a hut in a thatched house far from the village. The house has a bed, a bench and a stove. There were no mirrors. The mirror is a luxury for the poor farmer. And the farmer needs a mirror-or what? They are not so obsessed with their appearance.There was a dog and a cat in this farmer's hut. The dog's name is Burek and the cat's name is Cot. Both were born in the same week. No matter how little food he had for himself and his family, the farmer would never keep the dog and the cat hungry. The dog didn't see any dog, the cat didn't see any other cat, they just saw each other. So the dog thought he was a cat and the cat thought he was a dog. The truth is, their nature is not the same at all. Dogs would bark and cats would bark.Dogs would chase rabbits and cats would sit in ambush for rats. But all the animals are the same? Farmer's children are not all the same. As a result, Burek and Kot lived together. Often ate in one dish, trying to imitate each other. When Burek barked, Kot also tried to bark.</p>
